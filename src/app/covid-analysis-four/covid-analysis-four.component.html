		<span class="pr-analysis-report-subheader pr-font-chn">Motivation</span>
		<span class="pr-covid-analysis-report pr-font-rmono">In this short analysis, we have taken the datasets for India's nCoV-19 infected, recovered and deceased cases in steps of 5 days of gap between each reading and ranked each region based on each day's cumulative infection, recovery and deceased count. These results have then been plotted. These results have been calculated as per the <span class="pr-analysis-important-marker">latest availbale data (12 / 05 / 2020)</span>.</span>
		<span class="pr-covid-analysis-report pr-font-rmono">For each of the three datasets (confirmed, reocovered and deceased), we have first created a separate dataset where we have taken the cumulative count of each state / region for <span class="pr-analysis-important-marker">every 5 days</span>. Once this was done, we have then ranked each state for each day depending on their cumulative value for that day. Hence, for each day in our dataset, we have a rank for each state which varies from day to day. For each state / region, the rank may go up or go down depending on how the state has been able to control the pandemic in its own terms. A rank of 1 means it has the highest infection, deceased or recovery for that day. <span class="pr-analysis-important-marker">While a rank of 1 for infection and deceased means worst performing, a rank of 1 for recovering means best performing</span>. Once we plot these ranks over time, we can get a visual cue on how the states have performed over time against each other.</span>

		<span class="pr-covid-analysis-report pr-font-rmono">Figure 1 shows us the plotting of Kerala's rank over time. The first COVID-19 case in India was detected in Kerala, after which there were a huge number of patients from Kerala. Kerala was ahead in terms of total number of infection than the rest of the states / regions in India for some time after which it steeply dropped meaning that while the virus spread like wildfire in other states, Kerala was able to control it rather quickly.</span>
		<span class="pr-covid-analysis-report pr-font-rmono">In Figure 2 we plot all the regions of the country based on their ranks received each day. What is interesting to see is that there are quite a few sharp changes in the graph for a few states which shows that this pandemic has been very difficult to be controlled in most of the states in this country.</span>
		<span class="pr-covid-analysis-report pr-font-rmono">Figure 3 shows us a comparative plot between two randomly selected states, West Bengal and Gujarat. This is mainly to show that the script we have written, which can be found attached to this analysis as a Google Colab Notebook, can be used to compare these rankings of as many states as required by the user. It shall always run on the latest available data. We welcome you to go give it a try and find out new patterns between different states. In this case we see that while at the beginning both West Bengal and Gujarat had similar ranking in terms of number of confirmed cases, but one point Gujarat has spiked up further and then fallen since after which West Bengal has been performing worse at a constant pace.</span>
		<span class="pr-covid-analysis-report pr-font-rmono">Figure 4 shows us the comparative ranking of top five worst affected states in terms of infection spread. It takes into account Maharashtra, the most affected state in India, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh. We can see that while Maharashtra did take a small dip in the ranking initially, but later it consistantly kept itself to rank 1 for the rest of the analysis. Kerala shows a great performance with a steep drop in ranking in the early days.</span>
